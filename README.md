this small project help me to build my schedule.

my university gives me the lectures schedule in a pdf file, and in rows and columns format, so I need to convert it to a
table format(cvc file), and from there to display it in a calendar format.

so I wrote this small project to help me with that.

## How to use it
I write full directions in Hebrew [here]().
